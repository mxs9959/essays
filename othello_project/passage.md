IAGO</br>
&emsp; And let him find it. Trifles light as air</br>
&emsp; Are to the jealous confirmations strong</br>
&emsp; As proofs of holy writ. This may do something.</br>
&emsp; The Moor already changes with my poison;</br>
&emsp; Dangerous ==conceits=={description="conceptions, ideas"} are in their natures poisons,</br>
&emsp; Which at the first ==are scarce found to distaste=={description="scarcely offend the taste"},</br>
&emsp; But with a little act upon the blood</br>
&emsp; Burn like the ==mines of sulfur=={Q2255396}.</br>
</br>
_Enter Othello._</br>
</br>
&emsp; I did say so.</br>
&emsp; Look where he comes. Not ==poppy=={Q46452} nor ==mandragora=={Q2651366}</br>
&emsp; Nor all the ==drowsy syrups=={description="References poppy and madragora, from which narcotic syrups are sourced"} of the world</br>
&emsp; Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep</br>
&emsp; Which thou ==owedst=={description="had, experienced"} yesterday.</br>
OTHELLO  Ha, ha, false to me?</br>
IAGO </br>
&emsp; Why, how now, general? No more of that!</br>
OTHELLO </br>
&emsp; ==Avaunt!=={description="Word used to send away witches and devils"} Begone! Thou hast set me on ==the rack=={Q1351382}.</br>
&emsp; I swear ’tis better to be much ==abused=={description="deceived"}</br>
&emsp; Than but to know ’t a little.</br>
IAGO  How now, my lord?</br>
OTHELLO </br>
&emsp; What sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?</br>
&emsp; I saw ’t not, thought it not; it harmed not me.</br>
&emsp; I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and</br>
&emsp; merry.</br>
&emsp; I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.</br>
&emsp; He that is robbed, not wanting what is stol’n,</br>
&emsp; Let him not know ’t, and he’s not robbed at all.</br>
IAGO  I am sorry to hear this.</br>
OTHELLO </br>
&emsp; I had been happy if ==the general camp=={description="the whole army"},</br>
&emsp; ==Pioners=={Q13393921} and all, had tasted her sweet body,</br>
&emsp; ==So=={description="so long as"} I had nothing known. O, now, forever</br>
&emsp; Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!</br>
&emsp; Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars</br>
&emsp; That makes ambition virtue! O, farewell!</br>
&emsp; Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill ==trump=={Q8338},</br>
&emsp; The spirit-stirring drum, th’ ear-piercing fife,</br>
&emsp; The ==royal=={description="splendid"} banner, and all quality,</br>
&emsp; ==Pride, pomp, and circumstance=={description="proud display"} of glorious war!</br>
&emsp; And O you ==mortal engines=={Q81103}, whose rude throats</br>
&emsp; Th’ immortal ==Jove=={Q4649}’s ==dread clamors=={description="Jove's thunder"} ==counterfeit=={description="in other words, the cannons imitate Jove's thunder"},</br>
&emsp; Farewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone!</br>
IAGO  Is ’t possible, my lord?</br>
OTHELLO </br>
&emsp; Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore!</br>
&emsp; Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,</br>
&emsp; Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul,</br>
&emsp; Thou hadst been better have been born a dog</br>
&emsp; Than answer my waked wrath.</br>
IAGO  Is ’t come to this?</br>
OTHELLO </br>
&emsp; Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it</br>
&emsp; That the ==probation=={description="proof"} bear no hinge nor loop</br>
&emsp; To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!</br>
