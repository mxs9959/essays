&emsp; What sense had I of ==her=={Q3272719} <span style="color:green;">stol’n</span> hours of lust?</br>
</span>
<p class="comment"><i>Notice how Othello refers to Desdemona as if she is his property by using the word "stol'n." Othello's perceived ownership over Desdemona derives from his high class, which prioritizes the surveillance of women as a means to maintain family status. (I learned about this topic in AP Euro!) Other word choices that suggest ownership and objectification of women are colored <span style="color:green;">green</span> (as in "green with envy").</i></p>

&emsp; Let him not know ’t, and he’s not <span style="color:green;">robbed</span> at all.</strong></br>
</span>
<p class="comment"><i>The above pair of lines, I believe, reflects the essence of this excerpt. Through Othello, Shakespeare points out how ignorance, or "not wanting what is stol'n," is a more peaceful state of existence than being aware of a crime, so even if a person "is robbed," ignorance cannot be told apart from the case in which "he's not robbed at all."</i></p>

</span>
<p class="comment"><i>In his essay on </i>Othello<i>, Hoover H. Jordan argues that ironically, Othello's demise comes from the strength he has in his moral values, which would prevent him from forgiving Desdemona in the case she truly did sleep with Cassio. Because he cannot compromise his values, referenced here in his mention of "virtue," he chooses to follow Iago. He repeats the word "<span style="color: orange;">farewell</span>" out of his fear that he must part from his values. He follows his values militantly, hence the military references surrounding his farewells.<sup>1</sup></i></p>

</span>
<p class="comment"><i>As I also read in Jordan's essay, Othello's apparent obliviousness to Iago's deceit may reference the dismissive perspective of the upper class on the affairs of the lower class. Othello's remark that his "occupation's gone" indicates how his knowledge of Desdemona's alleged plot removes his sense of class, in turn supporting the idea Jordan references.<sup>1</sup></i></p>

&emsp; Than answer my <span style="color:red;">waked wrath</span> 😡.</br>
IAGO  Is ’t come to this?</br>
</span>
<p class="comment"><i>Notice how in all of his lines, Iago refrains from defending himself as Othello's rage grows. Instead, he takes the high road and blithely dismisses Othello's reaction as irrational, secretly content that his poison has infected him. Indeed, Iago positions himself to appear morally sound by not falling to the emotion he caused in Othello, in turn persuading Othello to trust him.</i></p>
<span class="main">
OTHELLO </br>
&emsp; Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it</br>
&emsp; That the ==probation=={description="proof"} bear no hinge nor loop</br>
&emsp; To hang a doubt on, or woe 😫 upon thy life!</br>
</span>
<p class="comment"><i>Shakespeare foreshadows Iago's execution by mentioning "hinge," "loop," and "hanging," which are the essential parts of the gallows. See the hinge and loop in the image to the right. The fact that Othello references a hanging suggests that he and Iago are at war, and neither will come out alive. In fact, as Jordan suggests in his essay, Othello commits suicide out of adherence to his values because he needed to punish himself for wrongfully murdering his wife.<sup>1</sup></i></p>
